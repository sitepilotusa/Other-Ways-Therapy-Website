Change to: 

Transformative Therapy in Colorado for Anxiety and Trauma

Updated Copy: 

Hi, I’m Molly!
 
I admire the courageous journey people take to heal from their painful life experiences in order to live a more present, integrated, meaningful life.
 
Whether you’re navigating the effects of trauma, anxiety, relationship challenges, experiencing a life transition, or seeking personal growth, I offer a safe space for you to find your own path towards healing.
 
As a Licensed Professional Counselor, Certified EMDR Clinician, IFS trained therapist, Ketamine Assisted Psychotherapy trained and Found of Other Ways Therapy, I honor the diversity of human experience and recognize that there is no one-size-fits-all approach to healing. My integrative therapy approach combines evidence-based modalities with a deep reverence for your innate wisdom and resilience.
 
 



I would like to change the copy in the purple blurb. But can we also remove the purple blurb and just make it the the same background as above or below? The light colored background with stenciled leaves?

What shifts are you hoping to see?
You’ve reached a point in your life where you’re craving true internal change. This may not be your first time in therapy. You’ve invested time and energy into your healing journey, yet you still find yourself hitting a wall. You’re thriving in many areas of your life, but you’re also surprised by the ways you feel stuck, unsure why certain patterns continue to show up.
Often, hidden anxiety is part of the picture. It has a way of being sneaky, making it hard to recognize even when you’re the one living with it. On the outside, you might look calm and capable, but inside you’re working overtime just to hold things together. That effort can feel exhausting.
Maybe you get triggered seemingly out of nowhere.
Your inner critic feels relentless, and you don’t know how else to respond to yourself.
No matter what you accomplish, a quiet voice insists you’re not enough.
It can show up in your relationships too. You may feel that push and pull tug of war, slip into people-pleaser mode, or lose touch with your own needs. Sometimes you second-guess your intuition or decisions because prioritizing others has always come first.
And when the emotions get too strong, you might find yourself shutting down.
You’d rather alphabetize your spice rack than sit with your feelings.
It feels safer to stay in your head, analyzing and intellectualizing, than to drop into what you feel. Or maybe you’re not even sure how.
This kind of anxiety doesn’t always make a scene, but it quietly chips away at your peace until it feels overwhelming.
Does this sound familiar?
It can be so disruptive when you’re trying to live the life you want but feel like there’s a glass wall between where you are and where you long to be.
You deserve relief.

Can we remove the green square background and replace it with the standard light background with stenciled leaves

Slightly adjusted copy: Can we remove the “Why Trauma Therapy?” line on my about me.

I want to add one more square under Professional Qualifications, although I don’t have a badge to make it more uniform to the others

Internal Family Systems, Level 1 
In 2025, I completed the Level 1 training program with the Internal Family Systems Institute to deepen my understanding of this transformative model for working with the parts of the self.

Since I am changing from doing solely Intensives, I would like to revamp this page a lot. We can remove all the information about EMDR Intensives and Complementary Modalities, since those will all be on the Services Page.

Therapy for Sneaky Anxiety & Trauma
Do These Thoughts Sound Familiar?
·   	"I'm exhausted from constantly 'holding it together' while no one realizes I'm drowning inside. My to-do lists are flawless, my performance is stellar, but the internal pressure is crushing me."
·   	"My friends call me the 'dependable one' or the 'rock,' but they don't see how my mind races with worst-case scenarios at 3 AM, or how I'm planning contingencies for conversations that haven't even happened yet."
·   	"I've mastered the art of helping everyone else with their problems while deflecting attention from my own struggles. I'm so good at functioning that even I sometimes forget how anxious I really am."
·   	"The thought of slowing down terrifies me more than burning out. If I'm not constantly productive or available for others, what value do I have? My worth feels tied to what I accomplish, not who I am."
·   	"I've built my life around anticipating and preventing problems before they happen. The constant vigilance is exhausting, but the alternative—letting go of control—feels impossible."
You're Not Alone
If these words resonate, you may be experiencing what I call "high-functioning" or "sneaky" anxiety- an anxiety that hides behind achievement, perfectionism, and caretaking. From the outside, your life may seem put-together, maybe even enviable. But inside, there’s a constant hum of worry, a never-ending to-do list, and a deep fear that if you stop, everything will fall apart.
What Is Sneaky Anxiety?
Sneaky anxiety often doesn’t look like panic attacks or obvious worry. Instead, it shows up as:
·   	Overpreparation for even minor events
·   	Difficulty saying no or setting boundaries
·   	Perfectionism that never feels “good enough”
·   	Hypervigilance about potential problems
·   	Excessive responsibility for others’ emotions and needs
·   	Mental exhaustion from constant planning and worrying
·   	Physical symptoms like tension headaches, digestive issues, or insomnia
Why Overfunctioning Matters
Overfunctioning, or doing more than is necessary, healthy, or sustainable, may very well be a coping mechanism that temporarily soothes anxiety by creating an illusion of control. These patterns may serve well-intentioned protective functions, but it can overshadow other parts of you that want rest, connection and ease. Over time, overfunctioning can lead to:
·   	Burnout and compassion fatigue
·   	Resentment in relationships
·   	Disconnection from your authentic needs and desires
·   	A sense of emptiness despite outward success
·   	Physical health consequences
How Therapy Can Help

Together, we can:
1. 	Meet your parts – Recognize and understand the parts of you that overfunction, people-please, or fear failure.
2. 	Uncover the roots – Using EMDR, we can process past experiences that contributed to these anxious adaptations.
3. 	Shift beliefs and patterns – Explore the beliefs driving your anxiety and overfunctioning, and help your parts feel safe enough to step back.
4. 	Practice sustainable self-care – Develop routines that feel possible, nourishing, and not selfish.
5. 	Cultivate self-compassion – Counter perfectionistic tendencies and honor all parts of you.
6. 	Strengthen boundaries – Create space that respects your needs without guilt.
7. 	Reconnect with your worth – Reclaim your value beyond productivity and achievement.
My Approach
I offer a compassionate, non-judgmental space where your experiences are validated. By combining Internal Family Systems (IFS) with EMDR, we can gently explore the protective parts that have kept you safe while uncovering and healing the root experiences that fuel your sneaky anxiety. Together, we’ll build practical strategies for sustainable well-being—so you can feel less like you’re “holding it all together” and more like you’re fully present with yourself and others.

What Is EMDR?
Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR) is a highly effective form of trauma treatment that has endless applications. You do not have to have a diagnosis of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder to benefit from EMDR. My clients seek out EMDR therapy because they have symptoms of anxiety, depression, or relationship patterns that they find puzzling, painful, or perhaps incongruent with other areas of their life.
When we begin the process of EMDR together, we explore what you are experiencing present day. My role is to help guide you in identifying which past experiences may be contributing to what feels presently stuck or distressing. Then, by utilizing bilateral stimulation techniques, such as back and forth eye movement, alternating vibrating buzzers, or tapping, we process these memories together by targeting the way the memory is stored in your nervous system—through your senses, thoughts/beliefs, emotions, and body sensations.
Just as trimming the top of a dandelion is only temporarily beneficial to the health of your yard's landscape, so too can less effective modalities be in addressing your symptoms. We want to identify and address the root of the issue. When approaching the present issue from this angle, the effects on your emotional health can be tremendous. EMDR is highly effective, and although it can have a reputation to be magic, it is not unicorns and rainbows, nor is it "microwave healing." However, this evidence-based practice addresses symptoms and patterns in a more targeted way, bringing down disturbances, and producing many positive ripple effects.

Ketamine Preparation & Integration

Ketamine with Therapeutic Support
Ketamine therapy can open doorways to profound healing and insight. I provide comprehensive support before and/or after your experience, helping you prepare mindfully and integrate meaningfully for lasting transformation.
Making Meaning from Your Ketamine Experience
Have you recently completed ketamine treatment at an IV clinic or through an at-home service? While ketamine can offer profound therapeutic breakthroughs, the real transformation often happens in the weeks and months that follow—through thoughtful integration of your experiences.
If you've found yourself wondering "What did that mean?" or "How do I carry this forward into my daily life?" you're not alone. Many people receive minimal integration support after their ketamine sessions, leaving valuable insights and healing potential unexplored.
How I Can Support Your Integration Journey
I specialize in helping clients make sense of their ketamine experiences and translate insights into lasting change. While I trained in KAP, I do not currently provide the ketamine treatment itself, I offer dedicated preparation and integration sessions designed to maximize the therapeutic benefits of your journey.
My Approach
EMDR Integration: Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing can be particularly powerful for processing trauma-related content that may have surfaced during your ketamine experience. We'll work together to integrate these revelations in a safe, structured way.
Internal Family Systems (IFS): Ketamine often brings awareness to different parts of ourselves. Using IFS, we'll explore the various aspects of your psyche that may have emerged, helping you develop a more compassionate relationship with all parts of yourself.

EMDR Consultation for Therapists
I am a Certified EMDR Therapist and EMDRIA Approved Consultant. I offer consultation for therapists at every stage of their EMDR journey—from those newly trained to those continuing to deepen and refine their clinical practice.
​Consultation is more than just checking the boxes for certification—it’s a space for you to deepen your clinical intuition, stay true to the EMDR model, and explore the flexibility it offers in real-world practice. We’ll also look at how EMDR can thoughtfully integrate with transformative approaches like Internal Family Systems (IFS) and Ketamine-Assisted Therapy and Integration, in ways that align with your clinical style and your clients' needs.
​My goal is to support your growth in competence, confidence, and curiosity—so your work feels grounded, responsive, and truly impactful.
My EMDR Journey
I completed my Basic Training in 2016. From the moment I began using EMDR, I was hooked. Where I had once felt stuck, I started to witness real movement. EMDR opened up a new dimension in my clinical work, and I’ve been passionately deepening my understanding ever since.
​I value ongoing learning as both a personal and professional cornerstone. I’m especially drawn to the natural nesting of modalities and the way they can enrich one another. While I honor the fidelity of the EMDR model, I also believe that therapy happens in the real world—it's dynamic, experiential, and sometimes calls for adaptation and creativity. That spirit of flexibility and integration is what led me to pursue further training in IFS and KAP.
I bring authenticity, curiosity, an astute clinical lens, and a good mix of practical tips and grounded skills to my consultation work—and yes, occasionally a mashed-up metaphor or two. I invite consultees to come as they are—not perfectly polished, but present, reflective, and open to growth. Consultation, to me, is a collaborative space centered on your learning. 
I am here to support your anywhere along your EMDR journey
You’ve Completed EMDR Basic Training…Now What?
You’ve learned the eight phases, practiced in triads, completed Basic Training Consultation and maybe even tried your first EMDR session with a client. But integrating EMDR into real-world cases can feel overwhelming.
Here’s how I can support you:
·   	Case conceptualization support
·   	Confidence in when and how to use EMDR
·   	Adjusting protocols for client readiness
·   	Creating safety and attunement in early sessions
You don’t have to figure it all out alone. This is the perfect time for consistent, collaborative consultation.
Building Momentum – Working Toward Certification
You're using EMDR more often and want to deepen your skills. Maybe you’re ready to pursue certification or simply want accountability and deeper learning.
Let’s work together on:
·   	Meeting your required 20 consultation hours
·   	Deepening your understanding of the Standard Protocol
·   	Adapting EMDR for dissociation, complex trauma, or co-occurring issues
·   	Honing your clinical instincts through feedback and reflection
I provide both individual and group consultation—tailored to your pace and learning style.
Advanced Integration & Intensives
You’re no longer just following the script—you’re shaping it. Now you're ready to explore how EMDR can evolve to meet your clients in transformative ways.
Explore with me:
·   	Implementing EMDR Intensives in your practice
·   	Integrating Internal Family Systems (IFS) with EMDR for parts work
·   	Using EMDR alongside psychedelic-assisted therapy (e.g., Ketamine)
·   	Ethical, clinical, and logistical guidance for blending modalities
This is where consultation turns into creative collaboration. Let’s expand what’s possible for your clients—and for you.
Need a Refresher? Just Returning to EMDR?
Life happens. EMDR can take a backseat sometimes. If you're feeling out of practice, uncertain, or disconnected from the method—you’re not alone.
And you’re in the right place.
​I offer thoughtful, encouraging consultation to help you get reacquainted with EMDR, rebuild your confidence, and reconnect with the work in a way that feels steady and authentic.

Isaac, this is so great. Thank you so so so much. 

The two things I would like to change are:

Eliminating the "Call Now" button. Historically, I never get calls for clients, only online submissions. When I have had my number posted- I just get a bunch of scam calls.

On the KAP page- under "Your KAP Journey", can we eliminate Step 1 and 2. And just have step 3 and 4? Integration Processing and Ongoing Support? 

Again, thank you so much. I am so happy with how this turned out and I appreciate all your effort and understanding along the way. Truly.

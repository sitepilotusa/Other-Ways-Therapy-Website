                    EMDR Intensives, or Retreats, are a more condensed version of EMDR therapy and can be offered in a variety of formats. Currently I offer EMDR Intensives ranging from 3 to 5 hours, in addition to our planning and integration sessions. While you may find Intensives offered all over the world, I am licensed to work only with clients who are present in the state of Colorado, either in-person near Denver or online from anywhere else in the state.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    When meeting on a weekly or biweekly basis, which is the traditional model of EMDR therapy, the work of opening up and closing down trauma processing in successive sessions can be a lot to manage, depending on your life circumstances. But it's not a bad thing. In fact, there are definite advantages to addressing trauma through this model of therapy and frequency of sessions. Pacing the work to allow your nervous system to process it at a speed that you are in control of and comfortable with, being present and spacious with the discomfort that arises, feeling what did not have the chance to be felt before, utilizing the wonderful coping strategies you have developed, and integrating what comes up in between weekly therapy sessionsâ€“ these are powerful and necessary components of trauma work.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Like the traditional model, EMDR Intensives address many of the same components of trauma work. EMDR Intensives are not necessarily a replacement, but can serve as a complement to other forms of therapy you are engaged in. At the table of so many powerful healing modalities, EMDR Intensives certainly have their place, bringing amazing benefits. One of the best: you may not have to manage as many symptoms in between sessions if you are doing an EMDR Intensive. As an alternative to taking off, cruising, and landing all in 50 minutes, an Intensive allows you to cruise at altitude for longer and take more time to comfortably land.

                    When Is An EMDR Intensive Not Recommended?

                  <p>
                    While there are no specific "rule outs" for an Intensive, as with most things, the answer is "it depends." It is best to discuss your specific circumstances, goals, and expectations during our consultation call.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    The following considerations may be an opportunity to check in with yourself and reflect whether you feel now is the time for you to do an EMDR Intensive.

                        If you are experiencing an ongoing stressor or traumatic event, or the storm has not quite passed, this can be an "it depends." Sometimes the trauma or stressor does not have a neat and tidy beginning, middle, and end, such as systemic oppression, ongoing medical trauma, climate change, politics, existential threats, relationship trauma, etc. In EMDR we do not process the stressors in and of themselves, but rather internal response to the stressor. Therefore, it is possible to address how the ongoing stressor or trauma is impacting you even if the circumstances are ongoing. EMDR can help address your nervous system response by bringing down the charge or distress and support you in building internal resources to cope more effectively. At the same time, more in-depth processing of past or current trauma does require a certain level of present engagement in regulation and adaptive coping. If you feel like you are currently trying to keep your head above water with the current level of stress, you may benefit from other forms of therapy, or a weekly EMDR format, to further prepare your nervous system for an Intensive.

                      <p>
                        Oftentimes what brings someone to therapy is a more recent experience that has impacted their ability to cope. When processing recent events, it is not uncommon for past experiences or trauma to be revealed, and perhaps not ever processed. A metaphor I love is viewing these more acute, present experiences as the foothills and the more longstanding past traumatic or unprocessed experiences as the mountains. (Gotta love a Colorado metaphor!) One EMDR Intensive will likely not address layers of trauma, but it may help address or bring down the foothills so that you can see the mountains. Or if you have addressed the foothills in previous therapy, an Intensive may help you address the mountains.

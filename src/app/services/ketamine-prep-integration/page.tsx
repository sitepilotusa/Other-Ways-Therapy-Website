      <p>
        Ketamine Assisted Psychotherapy (KAP) offers a unique opportunity to explore altered states of consciousness and access deeper layers of healing. This FDA-approved medication, when used in a therapeutic setting, can facilitate profound insights and emotional breakthroughs.
      </p>
      <p>
        Preparation is crucial for a meaningful ketamine experience. We work together to set intentions, address any concerns, and create the optimal mindset for your journey. During the session, I provide supportive guidance to help you navigate the experience safely.
      </p>
      <p>
        Integration is equally importantâ€”the real work often begins after the session ends. We process what emerged, helping you understand and incorporate new insights into your daily life, relationships, and ongoing healing journey.
